Data Preprocessing and Model Implementation for Predictive Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on preparing a dataset through data preprocessing and implementing custom machine learning models to predict outcomes. The steps include normalization of numerical features, preprocessing of categorical variables, handling missing values and outliers, and evaluation of models using performance metrics.

Steps in the Project
1. Data Preprocessing
Normalization of Numerical Features: Scaled numerical features to bring them into a comparable range for model training.
Preprocessing Categorical Variables: Encoded categorical variables using appropriate encoding methods.
Handling Missing Values and Outliers: Addressed missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity and model accuracy.
2. Model Implementation
Linear Regression: Implemented from scratch to predict outcomes using a linear approach.
Random Forest: Developed a custom Random Forest model for better handling of complex relationships between features.
XGBoost: Implemented XGBoost to leverage its boosting capabilities for performance improvement.
3. Performance Comparison
