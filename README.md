Data Preprocessing
Normalize numerical features.
Preprocess categorical variables.
Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.
Model Implementation
Implemented custom Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models from scratch.
Performance Comparison
Evaluated the models using R² metrics.
Feature Importance
Visualized feature importance for tree-based models (Random Forest and XGBoost).
Demonstrated how different features contribute to model predictions through visual insights.
Results
Performance metrics (R²) for Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Feature importance visualization highlighting key influential features for tree-based models.
Future Work
Further optimization of custom models.
Exploration of additional hyperparameters for tree-based models.
Implementation of more advanced data preprocessing techniques.
